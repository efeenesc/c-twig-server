## About

This server is an extremely crash-prone and vulnerable HTTP server written in C (ISO99) with just about enough functionality to serve basic HTML content.

Like its namesake, applying a tiny bit of force is enough to break it. It is cool to look at and play around with when found in the wild.

## Build

You have to have a C/C++ compiler (clang, gcc) and make installed. Run make on the Makefile and run the resulting executable file, preferably on anything but a public server. In fact it might be better to not use it in any scenario.
